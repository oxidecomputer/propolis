# Propolis

Propolis is a rust-based userspace for illumos bhyve.

## Building

### Prerequisites

Given the current tight coupling of the `bhyve-api` component to the ioctl
interface presented by the bhyve kernel component, running on recent illumos
bits is required.

At a minimum, the build must include the fix for
[14024](https://www.illumos.org/issues/14024). (Present since commit
[52fac30](https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/commit/52fac30e3e977464254b44b1dfb4717fb8d2fbde))

To build, run:

```bash
$ cargo build
```

## propolis crate

The main propolis crate is structured as a library providing the building
blocks to create bhyve backed VM instances. It also provides a number of
emulated devices that can be exposed to guests (e.g. serial port, virtio
devices, NVMe).

## propolis-server

Propolis is mostly intended to be used via a REST API to drive all of its
functionality. The standard `cargo build` will produce a `propolis-server`
binary you can run:

### Running

```
# propolis-server run <config_file> <ip:port>
```

Note that the server must run as root. One way to ensure propolis-server has
sufficient privileges is by using `pfexec(1)`, as such:

```
# pfexec propolis-server run <config_file> <ip:port>
```

### Example Server Configuration

**Note**: the goal is to move the device config from the toml
to instead be configured via REST API calls.

```toml
bootrom = "/path/to/bootrom/OVMF_CODE.fd"

[block_dev.alpine_iso]
type = "file"
path = "/path/to/alpine-extended-3.12.0-x86_64.iso"

[dev.block0]
driver = "pci-virtio-block"
block_dev = "alpine_iso"
pci-path = "0.4.0"

[dev.net0]
driver = "pci-virtio-viona"
vnic = "vnic_name"
pci-path = "0.5.0"
```

## propolis-cli

Once you've got `propolis-server` running you can interact with it via the REST
API with any of the usual suspects (e.g. cURL, wget). Alternatively, there's a
`propolis-cli` binary to make things a bit easier:

### Running

The following CLI commands will create a VM, start the VM, and then attach to
its serial console:

```
# propolis-cli -s <propolis ip> -p <propolis port> new <VM name>
# propolis-cli -s <propolis ip> -p <propolis port> state <VM name> run
# propolis-cli -s <propolis ip> -p <propolis port> serial <VM name>
```

## propolis-standalone

Server frontend aside, we also provide a standalone binary for quick
prototyping, `propolis-standalone`. It uses a static toml configuration:

## Running

```
# propolis-standalone <config_file>
```

Example configuration:
```toml
[main]
name = "testvm"
cpus = 4
bootrom = "/path/to/bootrom/OVMF_CODE.fd"
memory = 1024

[block_dev.alpine_iso]
type = "file"
path = "/path/to/alpine-extended-3.12.0-x86_64.iso"

[dev.block0]
driver = "pci-virtio-block"
block_dev = "alpine_iso"
pci-path = "0.4.0"

[dev.net0]
driver = "pci-virtio-viona"
vnic = "vnic_name"
pci-path = "0.5.0"
```

Propolis will not destroy the VM instance on exit.  If one exists with the
specified name on start-up, it will be destroyed and created fresh.

Propolis will create a unix domain socket, available at "./ttya",
which acts as a serial port. One such tool for accessing this serial port is
[sercons](https://github.com/jclulow/vmware-sercons), though others (such as
"screen") would also work.

### Quickstart to Alpine

In the aforementioned config files, there are three major components
that need to be supplied: The OVMF file, the ISO, and the VNIC.

Since this is a configuration file, you can supply whatever you'd like, but here
are some options to get up-and-running quickly:

#### OVMF

Using a bootrom from Linux works here - you can either build
your own [OVMF](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/OVMF), or you
can use a pre-built, which you can get [here](https://oxide-omicron-build.s3.amazonaws.com/OVMF_CODE.fd)
 or by running:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install ovmf && dpkg -L ovmf | grep OVMF_CODE.fd
```

#### ISO

Although there are many options for ISOs, an easy option that
should work is the [Alpine Linux distribution](https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/).

These distributions are lightweight, and they have variants
custom-built for virtual machines.

A straightforward option to start with is the "virtual" `x86_64` image.

The "extended" variant contains more useful tools, but will require a
modification of the kernel arguments when booting to see the console on the
serial port.  From Grub, this can be accomplished by pressing "e" (to edit),
adding "console=ttyS0" to the line starting with "/boot/vmlinuz-lts", and
pressing "Control + x" to boot with these parameters.

#### VNIC

To see your current network interfaces, you can use the following:

```bash
$ dladm show-link
```

To create a vnic, you can use one of your physical devices
(like "e1000g0", if you have an ethernet connection) as a link
for a VNIC. This can be done as follows:

```bash
NIC_NAME="vnic_prop0"
NIC_MAC="02:08:20:ac:e9:16"
NIC_LINK="e1000g0"

if ! dladm show-vnic $NIC_NAME 2> /dev/null; then
  dladm create-vnic -t -l $NIC_LINK -m $NIC_MAC $NIC_NAME
fi
```

#### Running a VM

After you've got the bootrom, an ISO, a VNIC, and a configuration file that
points to them, you're ready to create and run your VM. To do so, make sure
you've done the following:
- [build propolis](#Building)
- run the [propolis-server](#propolis-server)
- create your VM, run it, and hop on the serial console using [propolis-cli](#propolis-cli)
- login to the VM as root (no password)
- optionally, run `setup-alpine` to configure the VM (including setting a root
  password)
