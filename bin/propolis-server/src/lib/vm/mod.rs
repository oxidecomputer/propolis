//! Implements the VM controller: the public interface to a single Propolis
//! instance.
//!
//! The VM controller serves two purposes. First, it collects all of the objects
//! describing a single Propolis VM (the Propolis `Instance` itself, the
//! instance's spec, direct references to components in the instance, etc.).
//! Second, it records requests and events that affect how a VM moves through
//! the stages of its lifecycle, i.e. how and when it boots, reboots, migrates,
//! and stops.
//!
//! Each VM controller has a single "state driver" thread that processes
//! requests and events recorded by its controller and acts on the underlying
//! Propolis instance to move the VM into the appropriate states. Doing this
//! work on a single thread ensures that a VM can only undergo one state change
//! at a time, that there are no races to start/pause/resume/halt a VM's
//! components, and that there is a single source of truth as to a VM's current
//! state (and as to the steps that are required to move it to a different
//! state). Operations like live migration that require components to pause and
//! resume coordinate directly with the state driver thread.
//!
//! The VM controller's public API allows a Propolis Dropshot server to query a
//! VM's current state, to ask to change that state, and to obtain references to
//! objects in a VM as needed to handle other requests made of the server (e.g.
//! requests to connect to an instance's serial console or to take a disk
//! snapshot). The controller also implements traits that allow a VM's
//! components to raise events for the state driver to process (e.g. a request
//! from a VM's chipset to reboot or halt the VM).
