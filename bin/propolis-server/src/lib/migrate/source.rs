/// Specifies which pages should be offered during a RAM transfer phase.
///
/// On Dirty Pages and the Discipline Thereof
/// -----------------------------------------
///
/// In an ideal world, a migration would only ever transfer pages of the guest's
/// address space which have actually been touched by the guest; we don't want
/// to waste time sending a bunch of zero pages on the wire. RAM is offered to
/// the migration destination in two phases: first, we transfer the majority of
/// the guest's RAM prior to pausing the guest, and second, after pausing the
/// guest, we transfer any pages which have been touched since when we performed
/// the first transfer. This way, we perform most of the RAM transfer while the
/// guest is still running, and only re-transfer pages which have been dirtied
/// again while paused.
///
/// Transferring only dirty pages is made possible by bhyve's
/// `VM_TRACK_DIRTY_PAGES` and `VM_NPT_OPERATION`` ioctls. The
/// `VM_TRACK_DIRTY_PAGES` ioctl allows us to generate a bitmap of which pages
/// have their dirty flags set, allowing us to offer only those pages when
/// performing a RAM transfer. Because `VM_TRACK_DIRTY_PAGES`` also clears the
/// dirty bits, if we call the ioctl when offering the initial pre-pause RAM
/// transfer, and then again when performing the post-pause RAM transfer, the
/// second ioctl call will see only the dirty bits that were set *since* when
/// the initial transfer was performed, allowing us to offer only the pages
/// which have been touched since we transferred most of the memory.
///
/// Sounds simple enough, right? Well, here's where things get interesting.
/// Should a migration *fail* after transferring RAM, all the dirty bits on the
/// guest's pages will have been cleared by the `VM_TRACK_DIRTY_PAGES` ioctl.
/// This means that, for a naive implementation which just always transfers only
/// the pages marked as dirty by the ioctl, a second or third migration attempt
/// will not transfer any pages whose dirty bits were cleared by the first
/// migration attempt and haven't been touched again since then. This is bad
/// news! The guest has written to those pages, and, just because it hasn't
/// touched them since the last migration attempt, it may still care about that
/// memory, and attempt to read what it put there again in the future --- with
/// unpleasant results, if we haven't transferred that memory.
///
/// There are two potential ways we can solve this, and --- as you're about to
/// discover --- we implement both of them:
///
/// 1. The obvious solution: we can just offer all RAM in the pre-pause RAM push
///    phase, clearing any dirty bits, and then offer only dirty pages in the
///    post-pause RAM push phase. This has the nice property that it's trivially
///    correct no matter how many migration attempts it takes before we actually
///    migrate a guest successfully. It also has the less nice property that
///    we're offering a bunch of pages that the guest has never actually touched
///    and doesn't care about.
/// 2. The clever solution: what if we had a way to put the dirty bit *back*
///    after we've cleared it? If such a thing existed, we could record which
///    pages were dirty when we performed the RAM transfers, and then, should
///    the migration fail, go back and put those dirty bits *back*, so that a
///    potential future migration attempt will still see that those pages are
///    dirty and offer them again.
///
/// The good news is that there is, in fact, a way to do that, using the
/// `VM_NPT_OPERATION` ioctl's `VNO_OP_SET_DIRTY` operation (which, in Propolis,
/// we pronounce like [`VmmHdl::set_dirty_pages`]). However, the less good news
/// is that this ioctl isn't available in all the bhyve versions that Propolis
/// supports, as it was added in bhyve v17. Therefore, we implement both
/// solutions, depending on which bhyve version is present. If we have
/// VM_NPT_OPERATION, both the pre-pause and post-pause RAM push phases will use
/// [`RamOfferDiscipline::OfferDirty`], and only offer dirty pages, recording
/// any dirty bits that were cleared by the `VM_TRACK_DIRTY_PAGES` ioctl. If we
/// don't have `VM_NPT_OPERATION`, we use [`RamOfferDiscipline::OfferAll`] in
/// the pre-pause phase, and [`RamOfferDiscipline::OfferDirty`] only in the
/// post-pause phase. Because we can't put the dirty bits back, we have to offer
/// all the memory in the first phase, but we can still use dirty page tracking
/// to avoid re-offering pages that were transferred in the first phase when we
/// do the second RAM offer after pausing the guest.
