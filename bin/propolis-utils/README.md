# Propolis Utilities

This is a collection of assorted utilities which may be useful for certain
development activities, but are otherwise not meant for general consumption.

## Utilities

- `savex`:  Extract data fields from a `propolis-standalone` instance which was
  halted and saved with the `-s` flag.
- `cpuid-gen`: Generated CPUID profile using the legacy emulated output from the
  local host CPU, as filtered by the kernel VMM logic.
