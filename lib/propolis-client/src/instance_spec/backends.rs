//! Backend configuration data: the structs that tell Propolis how to configure
//! its components to talk to other services supplied by the host OS or the
//! larger rack.
//!
//! # Foreign types
//!
//! A full [`BackendSpec`] contains maps from backend names to backend
//! parameters that describe how to set up each backend. This crate assumes that
//! backend parameter versioning is handled by the crate's users: a Propolis
//! client that wants to send a full [`BackendSpec`] is responsible for
//! instantiating a Propolis version that will accept the [`BackendSpec`]
//! definition that the client wants to send (or for setting up a
//! [`BackendSpec`] that its Propolis will understand).
//!
//! During live migration, Propolis makes sure that the source and target have
//! the same backend names and categories, but allows their definitions to
//! differ. The [`BackendNames`] helper type converts from a full
//! [`BackendSpec`] to a collection of backend names that implements an
//! `is_migration_compatible` compatibility check.
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! This scheme means that the Propolis live migration procedure does not need
//! to deserialize any backend definitions sent from another Propolis. This
//! means that these definitions can change freely without creating a new
//! version of the `InstanceSpec` (provided that Nexus can still set up both
//! Propolis instances' [`BackendSpec`]s according to the rules above).
//!
//! [`BackendNames`] are, by contrast, a load-bearing part of the migration
//! protocol and need some care to be versioned correctly. See the struct
//! comments below for more information.
