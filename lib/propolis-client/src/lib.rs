//! A client for the Propolis hypervisor frontend's server API.

/// Re-exports of types related to instance specs.
///
/// These types are re-exported for the convenience of components like
/// sled-agent that may wish to expose instance specs in their own APIs.
/// Defining the sled-agent API in terms of these "native" types allows
/// sled-agent to reuse their trait implementations (and in particular use
/// "manual" impls of things that Progenitor would otherwise derive).
///
/// In the generated client, the native "top-level" instance spec and component
/// types ([`crate::instance_spec::VersionedInstanceSpec`],
/// [`crate::instance_spec::InstanceSpecV0`], and
/// [`crate::instance_spec::ReplacementComponent`]) replace their generated
/// counterparts. This obviates the need to maintain `From` impls to convert
/// between native and generated types.
